tl;dr: 
> A Speedrun-style learning platform for Soroban smart contracts. Developers complete progressive challenges (NFT, token vending, multi-sig, ZK demo), run tests locally or in Gitpod, submit proofs, and climb a public leaderboard. Open source. Designed for SCF #39



# Why
Learning Soroban today often means stitching docs, examples, CLI, and wallet UX by yourself. Stellar Speedrun Platform gives a single, opinionated path:
	•	Start coding in minutes (preconfigured env / Gitpod).
	•	Build real contracts in Rust on Futurenet/Testnet.
	•	See end-to-end dApp flows (frontend scaffolds with soroban-react + Freighter).
	•	Verify automatically; earn points, badges, and developer incentives.

# What you’ll build
	•	Challenge 01 — Hello NFT: Minimal NFT in Soroban + mint/display from a simple React UI.
	•	Challenge 02 — Token Vending Machine: Sell a token for XLM; balances, allowances, events.
	•	Challenge 03 — Multi-Sig Wallet: M-of-N approvals and secure execution patterns.
	•	Challenge 04 — ZK Proof Demo: Verify a simple proof inside a Soroban contract (
